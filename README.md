##Statements


Group A: Introduction to Databases

1. Study and design a database with suitable example using following database systems:
• Relational: SQL / PostgreSQL / MySQL
• Key-value: Riak / Redis
• Columnar: Hbase
• Document: MongoDB / CouchDB
• Graph: Neo4J
Compare the different database systems based on points like efficiency, scalability,
characteristics and performance.

2. Install and configure client and server for MySQL and MongoDB (Show all commands and
necessary steps for installation and configuration).

3. Study the SQLite database and its uses. Also elaborate on building and installing of SQLite.


Group B: SQL and PL/SQL

1. Design any database with at least 3 entities and relationships between them. Apply DCL and
DDL commands. Draw suitable ER/EER diagram for the system.

2. Design and implement a database and apply at least 10 different DML queries for the
following task. For a given input string display only those records which match the given
pattern or a phrase in the search string. Make use of wild characters and LIKE operator for
the same. Make use of Boolean and arithmetic operators wherever necessary.

3. Execute the aggregate functions like count, sum, avg etc. on the suitable database. Make use
of built in functions according to the need of the database chosen. Retrieve the data from
the database based on time and date functions like now (), date (), day (), time () etc. Use
group by and having clauses.

4. Implement nested sub queries. Perform a test for set membership (in, not in), set
comparison (<some, >=some, <all etc.) and set cardinality (unique, not unique).

5. Write and execute suitable database triggers .Consider row level and statement level
triggers.

6. Write and execute PL/SQL stored procedure and function to perform a suitable task on the
database. Demonstrate its use.
 

7. Write a PL/SQL block to implement all types of cursor.

8. Execute DDL statements which demonstrate the use of views. Try to update the base table
using its corresponding view. Also consider restrictions on updatable views and perform
view creation from multiple tables.

Group C: MongoDB

1. Create a database with suitable example using MongoDB and implement
• Inserting and saving document (batch insert, insert validation)
• Removing document
• Updating document (document replacement, using modifiers, upserts, updating
multiple documents, returning updated documents)

2. Execute at least 10 queries on any suitable MongoDB database that demonstrates following
querying techniques:
• find and findOne (specific values)
• Query criteria (Query conditionals, OR queries, $not, Conditional semantics)
• Type-specific queries (Null, Regular expression, Querying arrays)

3. Execute at least 10 queries on any suitable MongoDB database that demonstrates following:
 $ where queries
• Cursors (Limits, skips, sorts, advanced query options)
• Database commands

4. Implement Map reduce example with suitable example.

5. Implement the aggregation and indexing with suitable example in MongoDB. Demonstrate
the following:
• Aggregation framework
• Create and drop different types of indexes and explain () to show the advantage of the
indexes.

Group D: Mini Project / Database Application Development

Student group of size 3 to 4 students should decide the statement and scope of the project which
will be refined and validated by the faculty considering number of students in the group.
Draw and normalize the design up to at ER Diagram least 3NF in case of back end as RDBMS.

Suggested Directions for development of the mini project.

• Build a suitable GUI by using forms and placing the controls on it for any application. (E.g
Student registration for admission, railway reservation, online ticket booking etc.). Proper
data entry validations are expected.

• Develop two tier architecture and use ODBC/JDBC connections to store and retrieve data
from the database. Make a user friendly interface for system interaction. You may consider
any applications like employee management system, library management system etc.

• Implement the basic CRUD operations and execute a transaction that ensures ACID
properties. Make use of commands like commit, save point, and rollback. You may use
examples like transfer of money from one account to another, cancellation of e-tickets etc.
